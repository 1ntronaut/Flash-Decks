In short the format is simple

The `deck.csv` file should have colon `:` separated values in 4 columns

Organized like this:

> `category:question:answer:0`

- **First Field:** _The category of the flashcard_
- **Second Field:** _The Question being asked_
- **Third Field:** _The Hidden Answer_
- **Fourth Field:** _The Score*_

> \* The score determines how often which cards are shown. A good idea is to start all of the cards out at 0 so they are all served to the user equally.

If your deck does not quite fit into one of the existing category folders, by all means file an issue or include a proper subject area directory with your pull request.
